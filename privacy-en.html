    <h1>Elevate Habits Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="header-info">
        <p>This privacy policy is applicable to the Elevate Habits app (hereinafter referred to as the "Application"), which was developed by <strong>Khanh</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider").</p>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-11-14T12:00:00Z</p>
        <p>These policies may be updated from time to time to comply with law and adjust to new app features. Please review them periodically.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
    <p>To provide Elevate Habits services, we collect the following types of data from you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Includes email, username, and avatar URL. This data is collected when you register or update your profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Habit Data:</strong> Includes the name, description, color, type, frequency of habits, and daily logs of completion status (completed, skipped, missed).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>The Application may also automatically collect certain basic technical information when issues occur:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Information collected when the application encounters an error, including the state of the device at the time of the crash.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Device Information:</strong> Mobile operating system and application version used. This data is collected via Firebase Crashlytics to improve stability and for error reporting, and is aggregated and anonymized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> Habit data and logs are used to track progress, generate deep analytical reports, and provide the core features of the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Reminder Management:</strong> We utilize device permissions for Exact Alarms and Notifications to schedule timely habit reminders based on your settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Profile information helps personalize the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Support and Communication:</strong> Your email is used for account verification and to assist you when necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    <p>Elevate Habits uses third-party services to operate and provide features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> This is our primary Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform. We use <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> for user account management and <strong>Cloud Firestore</strong> to securely and synchronously store all data (profile, habits, logs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your data with robust security measures. All requests to Firestore must be authenticated via Firebase Authentication. Furthermore, we have configured Firestore security rules to ensure users can only read, write, and modify their own data, preventing any unauthorized access. While we employ reasonable measures, no security system is completely impenetrable.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights and Opt-out</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, modify, or delete your personal data at any time through in-app features. If you wish to delete your account and all associated data, please use the in-app functionality or contact us at <strong>dev.ddkhanh@gmail.com</strong> for assistance. You can easily halt all collection of information by uninstalling the Application.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. Automatically Collected information (such as crash logs) will be retained for up to 24 months and may thereafter be stored in aggregate.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian, please contact us if you have concerns about your child's data.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Policy and Notification</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date on this page. Continued use of the Application after a policy change is deemed approval of all such changes.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact us via our official email <strong>dev.ddkhanh@gmail.com</strong> for additional support.</p>
